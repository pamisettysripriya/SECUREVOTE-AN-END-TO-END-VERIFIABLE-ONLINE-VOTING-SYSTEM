# SecureVote – Privacy Preserving Online Voting System

SecureVote is a secure web-based electronic voting system that ensures voter privacy, election transparency, and verifiable results using modern cryptographic techniques.

The system uses **Paillier Homomorphic Encryption** to keep votes encrypted while still allowing accurate vote counting. It also implements **threshold decryption**, where the private key is split among trustees so that no single authority can decrypt votes.

The platform includes OTP authentication, encrypted vote casting, duplicate vote prevention, and a public bulletin board for auditability, making it suitable for college elections, company voting, and community decision making.

# System Workflow

1. Admin creates an election with candidates.
2. Voters authenticate using OTP.
3. Voters select a candidate and submit their vote.
4. Votes are encrypted on the client side before reaching the server.
5. Encrypted ballots are stored on a public bulletin board.
6. After voting ends, the admin tallies results using threshold decryption.
7. Final results are displayed without revealing individual votes.
